= How to launch tests from an IDE

== Gradle launch

Launch the gradle task corresponding to `:clustered:integration-test:test`.

If that doesn't work (possibly caused by a warning saying `warning: [options] bootstrap class path not set in conjunction with -source 1.6`)
try the Java launch.

== Java launch

1. Create the kit with `gradle :clustered:integration-test:copyServerLibs`
2. Launch the test once to make it fail
3. Edit the test configuration to add the following VM options:

`-Dcom.tc.l2.lockmanager.greedy.locks.enabled=false -DkitInstallationPath=build/ehcache-kit/ehcache-clustered-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT-kit`
