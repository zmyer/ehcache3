== Introduction

This guide provides sample code snippets to help migrate Ehcache 2.x code to Ehcache 3.x code.

[[per-mapping-expiry]]
== Per Mapping Expiry

Per mapping expiry covers use cases where a subset of mappings have different expiration settings than the ones configured at the cache level.

=== Ehcache 2.x Code snippet
Here we are creating a cache manager having a default time-to-live (TTL) expiry. +
Before adding we verify the expiry and set it on the Element only when different than the Cache one.

----
include::{sourcedir33}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/Ehcache2.java[tag=CustomExpiryEhcache2]
----
<1> Expiry duration defined at the cache level.
<2> Compute the mapping expiry using helper method getTimeToLiveInSeconds.
<3> Only setting the computed expiry on element, if other than default expiry.
<4> Waiting for 2.1 seconds - assuming 2 seconds is the custom expiry duration - to get the mapping to be expired.

=== Corresponding Ehcache 3.x Code Snippet
Here we are creating a cache manager with a cache configuration having custom expiry, having methods to be called during the lifecycle of added mappings.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir33}/impl/src/test/java/org/ehcache/docs/Ehcache3.java[tag=CustomExpiryEhcache3]
----
<1> Defining Custom Expiry to be called during the lifecycle of added mappings.
<2> During mapping creation, defining expiry duration using the helper method getTimeToLiveDuration.
<3> Waiting for 2.1 seconds - assuming 2 seconds is the custom expiry duration - to get the mapping to be expired.

****
So to migrate the Ehcache 2.x per mapping expiry code to Ehcache 3.x, move expiry computation logic to getExpiryForCreation method of Custom Expiry.
